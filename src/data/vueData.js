        These aren't ordinary telephone operators - they're COSMIC BEINGS who can instantly 
        transport messages across the digital universe! When a user clicks a button, 
        the operator immediately shouts "CLICK MESSAGE INCOMING!" and delivers it 
        to the right component faster than light speed.
        
        Each operator specializes in different types of messages: Click Operator handles clicks, 
        Keyboard Operator manages typing, Mouse Operator tracks movements, and Form Operator 
        deals with submissions. They work together like a perfectly synchronized cosmic orchestra!
        
        The @ symbol is their cosmic telephone - @click means "Call the Click Operator," 
        @keyup means "Get the Keyboard Operator on the line!"

        But here's the really magical part - every component in the academy has a LIFE STORY! 
        They're born (mounted), they live their life (updated), and eventually they graduate (unmounted). 
        Just like Harry Potter going through different years at Hogwarts, components go through 
        different lifecycle phases, and you can cast spells at each phase!
        
        onMounted() is like the Sorting Hat ceremony, onUpdated() is like getting new spells each year,
