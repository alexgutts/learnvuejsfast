## 📋 Deployment Steps for Hostinger

### Step 1: Access Your Hostinger File Manager
1. Log into your Hostinger account
2. Go to your hosting control panel
3. Open the File Manager

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Target Directory
1. Navigate to `public_html/sideproy/vue/`
2. If the `sideproy` or `vue` folders don't exist, create them first
3. If you have an old version, delete the old files first (recommended)

### Step 3: Upload the Latest Files
1. Upload the `vue-learning-app-deployment-latest.zip` file
2. Extract/unzip the file in the `vue` directory
3. Delete the zip file after extraction (optional, for cleanup)

### Step 4: Verify the Structure
After extraction, your directory structure should look like:
```
public_html/
└── sideproy/
    └── vue/
        ├── index.html
        ├── favicon.ico
        ├── .htaccess
        └── assets/
            ├── index-DJBoPXzC.css
            └── index-Cy5MSPds.js

## 🛠️ What the .htaccess File Does

The included `.htaccess` file provides:
- **SPA Routing**: Redirects all requests to `index.html` for proper Vue Router functionality
- **Security Headers**: Adds security headers to protect against common attacks
- **Caching**: Optimizes loading speed by caching static assets for 1 month
- **Compression**: Reduces file sizes for faster loading

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If the app doesn't load:
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check that all files were uploaded correctly
3. Verify the file permissions (usually 644 for files, 755 for folders)
4. Make sure the .htaccess file was uploaded (it's a hidden file)

### If navigation doesn't work:
1. Ensure the .htaccess file is in the root directory of your Vue app
2. Check that Apache mod_rewrite is enabled (usually enabled on Hostinger)
3. Try accessing direct URLs to test routing

### If styles don't load:
1. Verify the assets folder and files are present
2. Check the browser console for any 404 errors
3. Ensure file names match: `index-DJBoPXzC.css` and `index-Cy5MSPds.js`
